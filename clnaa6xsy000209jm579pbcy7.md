### **9)** [**Amazon Web Services ( AWS )**](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?trk=14a4002d-4936-4343-8211-b5a150ca592b&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=Cj0KCQjw1OmoBhDXARIsAAAYGSFLyyxHuZsLf4aXdJbwfh1gh-T0-dqrHmZBvvsfrYfloQh7_AG6l1caAu8QEALw_wcB%3AG%3As&s_kwcid=AL%214422%213%21453325184782%21e%21%21g%21%21aws%2110712784856%21111477279771&all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free+Tier+Types=*all&awsf.Free+Tier+Categories=*all)

<mark>I can say </mark> **<mark>AWS is the Biggest and best Web Services Provider Currently ( With Google Cloud Platform and Azure )</mark>**<mark>.</mark> They Provide Basic to industry-level required Features to their users. I have been using for 2 years and I love it.

> **<mark>PROS:</mark>**

* **<mark>AWS offers an extensive array of cloud services,</mark>** including computing, storage, databases, machine learning, analytics, and more. This breadth of services caters to a wide range of use cases.
    
* **<mark>AWS has data centers (availability zones) in multiple regions worldwide,</mark>** allowing you to deploy applications and services close to your target audience for improved performance.
    
* **<mark>Provides robust scaling options</mark>**<mark>,</mark> allowing you to easily adjust resources up or down to meet changing demands, which is particularly useful for growing businesses.
    
* **<mark>boasts a high level of reliability and uptime,</mark>** with redundancy built into its infrastructure to ensure minimal downtime.
    
* **<mark>Offers a wide range of security features and compliance certifications</mark>**<mark>,</mark> making it a **<mark>trusted choice for businesses</mark>** with stringent security requirements.
    

> **<mark>CONS:</mark>**

* **<mark>Complexity</mark>**
    

* While AWS provides cost management tools, the **<mark>cost structure can be complex, and users must actively monitor their usage to avoid unexpected expenses.</mark>**
    
* **<mark>Some users find AWS pricing to be higher than other cloud providers, especially if not managed efficiently.</mark>**
    
* **<mark>AWS offers different levels of support, and premium support plans can be expensive for smaller businesses.</mark>**
    
* **<mark>Extensive use of AWS services can lead to vendor lock-in, making it challenging to migrate to other cloud providers if needed.</mark>**
