**I know they are not extensions but,**

In Visual Studio Code, the ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù and ‚ÄúSource Control‚Äù functionalities play vital roles in enhancing productivity and managing code revisions.

**Search:** This feature allows you to quickly find specific content within your project. By using keywords, regular expressions, or even file paths, you can efficiently locate and navigate through your codebase. The search tool provides options for case-sensitive searches, whole-word matches, and allows you to perform global searches across multiple files.

**Source Control:** This is where you manage version control systems like Git. It enables you to track changes, review modifications, commit code, create branches, and handle merges, all within the VS Code interface. The source control view provides a clear overview of file changes and allows you to stage, commit, push, and pull changes to and from the repository.

By utilizing these features, developers can seamlessly navigate, search, and manage code changes in their projects, streamlining their workflow directly within Visual Studio Code.
